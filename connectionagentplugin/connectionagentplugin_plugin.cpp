/*
 *This class is for accessing connman's UserAgent from multiple sources.
 *This is because currently, there can only be one UserAgent per system.
 *
 *It also makes use of a patch to connman, that allows the UserAgent
 *to get signaled when a connection is needed. This is the real reason
 *this daemon is needed. An InputRequest is short lived, and thus, may
 *not clash with other apps that need to use UserAgent.
 *
 *When you are trying to intercept a connection request, you need a long
 *living process to wait until such time. This will immediately clash if
 *a wlan needs user Input signal from connman, and the configure will never
 *get the proper signal.
 *
 *This qml type can be used as such:
 *
 *import com.jolla.connection 1.0
 *
 *    ConnectionAgent {
 *       id: userAgent
 *        onUserInputRequested: {
 *            console.log("        onUserInputRequested:")
 *        }
 *
 *       onConnectionRequest: {
 *          console.log("onConnectionRequest ")
 *            sendSuppress()
 *        }
 *        onErrorReported: {
 *            console.log("Got error from connman: " + error);
 *       }
 *   }
 *
